# EvalForge - Product Requirements Document Summary

## Executive Summary

EvalForge is a comprehensive LLM observability and evaluation platform that automates the entire development lifecycle from tracing to optimization. Unlike existing fragmented solutions, EvalForge provides a unified platform combining real-time observability, AI-powered evaluation generation, closed-loop prompt optimization, and enterprise-grade agent serving capabilities.

## Problem Statement

Organizations building LLM applications face a fragmented toolchain requiring multiple point solutions for observability, evaluation, A/B testing, and optimization. Current platforms lack:

- **Automatic evaluation creation** from prompt analysis
- **Closed-loop optimization** where evaluations drive prompt improvements

## Technical Architecture Summary

### Local Development Stack
```yaml
services:
  # Core Services
  api: Go backend with hot reload
  dashboard: React with Vite
  
  # Databases
  postgres: Latest with migrations
  clickhouse: Latest with schema
  redis: Latest for caching/queues
  
  # Mock Services

```

### Production Architecture
- **Initial (10K events/sec)**: Single Kubernetes cluster, managed databases
- **Growth (25K events/sec)**: Multi-region, read replicas, Kafka
- **Scale (50K+ events/sec)**: Custom infrastructure, dedicated DevOps team

### Technology Decisions
- **Backend**: Go (not Rust initially, except data pipeline)
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + Tailwind
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL + ClickHouse
- **Queue**: Redis → Kafka (when needed)
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **ClickHouse Complexity**: Start with managed service, hire expert
2. **Scaling Bottlenecks**: Build backpressure from day 1
3. **Data Consistency**: Event sourcing pattern, idempotent operations

### Business Risks
1. **Slow Adoption**: Focus on immediate ROI, generous free tier
2. **Competition**: Fast iteration, unique optimization features
3. **High CAC**: Developer-first content strategy

## Next Steps

1. **Week 1 Actions**
   - Set up GitHub repository
   - Create Docker Compose environment
   - Hire first backend engineer
   - Begin SDK development

2. **Success Criteria for Proceeding**
   - Local development environment complete
   - First SDK prototype working
   - 5 design partners committed
   - Technical feasibility validated

3. **Go/No-Go Decision Points**
   - Week 8: MVP validation
   - Week 16: Product-market fit
   - Week 24: Series A readiness

## Conclusion

This plan balances ambitious goals with pragmatic execution. By focusing on local-first development and outstanding developer experience, we can iterate quickly while building a foundation for scale. The phased approach allows for continuous validation and course correction based on real customer feedback.

Remember: **Ship fast, learn faster, scale when customers demand it.**

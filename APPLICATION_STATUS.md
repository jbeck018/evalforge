- Full TypeScript types
- Promise-based API
- Automatic retry logic
- OpenAI compatibility layer
- Location: `/sdks/javascript/`

### 5. **Development Environment**
- Complete Docker Compose setup
- Mock LLM services for offline development
- Hot reloading for all services
- Comprehensive Makefile with 40+ commands
- Pre-commit hooks and code quality tools
- Location: `/docker-compose.yml`, `/Makefile`

## 🧪 Testing Infrastructure

### Automated Tests
- **E2E Test Suite**: `/test_evalforge_e2e.py`
  - Service health checks
  - Authentication flow
  - SDK integration
  - Event ingestion
  - Analytics queries
  - Performance testing
  - Error handling
  - Data persistence

### Manual Testing
- **Quick Test Script**: `/quick_test.py`
- **Testing Guide**: `/QUICK_START_TESTING.md`

## 📊 Performance Targets

- **API Response Time**: <100ms (P95)
- **Event Ingestion**: 10,000+ events/second
- **Dashboard Load**: <2 seconds
- **SDK Overhead**: <1ms per call
- **Setup Time**: <15 minutes

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Start Services
```bash
# Ensure Docker is running
docker info

# Start all services
make dev

# Or use quick test
python quick_test.py
```

### 2. Access Application
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- API Docs: http://localhost:8080/swagger
- Grafana: http://localhost:3001
- ClickHouse: http://localhost:8123

### 3. Run Tests
```bash
# Comprehensive E2E tests
python test_evalforge_e2e.py

# Performance tests
make perf-test

# Check service health
make health-check
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Run E2E Tests**: Validate all components work together
   ```bash
   python test_evalforge_e2e.py
   ```

2. **Manual Testing**: Try the application yourself
   - Create an account
   - Integrate SDK into a test app
   - View analytics in dashboard

   ```bash
   make perf-test
   ```

4. **Customer Validation**: Deploy to staging for design partners

## 📝 Notes

- All services run locally without external dependencies
- Mock LLM providers included for cost-free testing
- Data is persisted in Docker volumes
- Use `make clean` to reset everything

The MVP is now ready for comprehensive testing and validation! 🎉
